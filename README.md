# TODO
- Setup debugger.
- https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html
- https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity.
- asm-lsp creates a `.o` file in `lib/src` wtf?
- asm-lsp thinks we're doing `GAS` instead of `nasm`.
- Read about ELF format and sections.

# Subject
## Common instructions
- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules `$(NAME)`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean` and
`re`. It must recompile/relink only the necessary files.
- You must write **64-bit** assembly, beware of the "calling convention".
- You **can’t do** inline ASM, you must do ’*s’ files.
- You must compile your assembly code with nasm.
- You must use the **Intel syntax**, not the AT&T syntax.
- It is forbidden to use the compilation flag: `-no-pie`.

## Mandatory part

- The library must be called `libasm.a`.
- You must submit a main function that will test your functions and compile with
your library to demonstrate that it is functional.
### Functions
- You must rewrite the following functions in assembly:
	- ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
	- ft_strepy (man 3 strepy)
	- ft_stremp (man 3 strcmp)
	- ft write (man 2 write)
	- ft_read (man 2 read)
	- ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)
- You must check for errors during syscalls and handle them properly when needed.
- Your code must set the variable errno properly. For that, you are allowed to call the extern `___error` or `errno_location`.


# Commands
List the symbols in the lib
```bash
nm lib/libasm.so
```

## Generate assembly
To generate asm from c code you can use the following command
```
gcc <FILE.C> -S -masm=intel -Og -fverbose-asm
```
- `-masm` sets the dialect, options are: [`att`, `intel`].
- `-Og` suppresses any code optimization passes, giving us a pretty clear view to how the code relates to the assembly.
- `fverbose-asm` adds extra comments to make the assembly more readable.
```
objdump -M intel -d
```


# Dev setup
## Toolchain
### clang-format
[clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) is part of clang-tools, install with.
```bash
apt install clang-tools
```
### prek
This will install [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) into `~/.local/bin`
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/download/v0.2.27/prek-installer.sh | sh
```
### nasm
Not installed by default on my pop-os.
```
apt install nasm
```

## Dependencies
- [criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion?tab=readme-ov-file#packages) for unit tests.


# 🤓 Knowledge


## Makefile automatic variables
[gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables)[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3220288)
```makefile
all: library.cpp main.cpp
```
- `$@` evaluates to all
- `$<` evaluates to library.cpp
- `$^` evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp

## ELF
### Sections
From: `man elf`

- `.bss` (Block Starting Symbol) holds the statically allocated variables that have not been assigned.
- `.text` holds the "text", or executable instructions of a program.
- `.data` holds initialized data, its writable (`SHF_WRITE`).
- `.rodata` read-only data, such as `const` variables..

!> [!NOTE] Note to self
> I've only seen `.bss` when declaring a global var, not when declaring a static inside a function.

## Memory
### mov vs lea
- `LEA` means Load Effective Address
- `MOV` means Load Value

`LEA` moves a pointer to whatever you're addressing, whereas `MOV` load the value.




## Architecture
### x86-64
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)
x86-64 is a 64-bit extension of the x86 instruction set.
